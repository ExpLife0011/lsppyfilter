Overview:
---------

LspPyFilter offers the ability to dynamically and transparently modify incoming
and outgoing network traffic, as well as to redirect outgoing connection
requests. This is achieved through the use of a Windows Layered Service
Provider, together with an embedded Python interpreter instance.

Traffic is modified on-the-fly, by dynamically loadable Python scripts, and
LspPyFilter now includes the structure necessary to allow for the easy
transformation of HTTP traffic (i.e. Content-Length headers are fixed up
automatically). This ability is implemented entirely in Python!
